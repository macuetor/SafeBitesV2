# SafeBites

SafeBites is an application that allows you to quickly and easily discover the nutritional values of a food
by scanning its barcode, in order to decide if it is suitable for your personal consumption, as well as 
making a quick comparison between two products to analyse which is healthier.

- Scan the barcode of a food product and discover instantly if it fits with your personal conditions for safe consumption.
- Compare the nutritional information between two products to facilitate your choice at the time of purchase.
- You can save as favourites all products that fit your profile to have at your fingertips the information of your favourite foods.
- If a product is not found, we offer support to introduce the new food to the database, collaborating with it.

## Intended user
The target user for this application is anyone who cares about their health and has doubts when choosing a product
among the large number of alternatives as to which is healthier.
